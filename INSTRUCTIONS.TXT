Robot App

You are given a file like: Sample.txt

It contains zero to many (in this case 3) journeys. Here's the first one:

1 1 E
RFRFRFRF
1 1 E

Each one starts with the initial coordinates of the robot (1 1 in this case) and the direction it is pointing in. In this case E = East. The directions are as follows:

N = North
E = East
S = South
W = West

Following the starting conditions are a list of commands:

RFRFRFRF

Each character is a command, either to turn (L = left, R = right) or to move forwards (F).

Finally, the journey ends with another set of coordinates and a direction. This is the expected position and orientation of your robot at the end of the journey. Your program should check that it ends at the specified coordinates and facing in the given direction.

The challenge is to parse the input file, set the start position of your robot, then have it execute the instructions and check its final position with the expected position.

It should take the filename as an argument i.e. RobotApp.exe Sample.txt. It should handle invalid inputs gracefully.

Write your code as though it was for a real project: make it maintainable, readable and clean.
